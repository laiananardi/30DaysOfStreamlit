How to Deploy a Streamlit App

1. Sign In:
   - Use your GitHub or Gmail credentials to sign in to Streamlit Cloud: https://streamlit.io/cloud

2. Deploy the App:
   - Select the repository, branch, and file that contains your Streamlit app.
   - Click "Deploy."

3. Automatic Updates:
   - After deployment, any time you run `git push`, your app will update automatically.

Additional Information:

- Ensure your project includes a `requirements.txt` file.
- To generate this file automatically, use the following command:
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
- Place the `requirements.txt` file in the root directory of your repository.
- Use relative paths for all file references in your app (e.g., `assets/file.csv`).
